# 🚨 Task: Comprehensive Error Handling Implementation

**Status:** 🟢 Ready  
**Priority:** P2 - Important  
**Effort:** 2 days  
**Impact:** High

## 📋 Overview

Implement robust error handling throughout the Mirei app to prevent crashes, provide meaningful user feedback, and ensure graceful failure recovery. This will be implemented after the core user flow is established.

## 🎯 Requirements

### Current Issues

- ❌ App crashes on network failures
- ❌ Database errors not handled gracefully
- ❌ No user feedback for failed operations
- ❌ Silent failures in background processes
- ❌ Inconsistent error handling patterns

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Zero unhandled exceptions causing crashes
- ✅ Meaningful error messages for users
- ✅ Graceful degradation when services fail
- ✅ Consistent error handling patterns across app
- ✅ Error logging for debugging and monitoring

## 📝 Notes

- **Moved to P2**: Will be implemented after onboarding and authentication flow
- **Still Critical**: Essential for production readiness
- **Foundation Ready**: Onboarding/auth will provide stable base for error handling
- **User Experience**: Better to have working auth flow first, then add error handling

**Estimated Time:** 2 days  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** Onboarding and authentication flow completed  
**Blocks:** Production deployment, advanced features  
**Enables:** Stable user experience, debugging capabilities
