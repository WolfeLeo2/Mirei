## 📊 **Priority Framework**

Tasks are organized using a **Priority Matrix** based on:

- **P2 - Important**: Should be completed after P1 tasks
- **P3 - Nice to Have**: Can be scheduled for later

Each task is evaluated on:

- **Impact**: User experience improvement
- **Urgency**: How quickly it needs to be addressed
- **Effort**: Development time and complexity required

## 🎯 **Benefits Tracking**

Every task includes:

- **User Benefits**: How it improves the user experience
- **Technical Benefits**: How it improves the codebase
- **Business Benefits**: How it impacts app success
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure completion success

## 📈 **Usage Guidelines**
